    <string name="CarelessWhisper">I feel so unsure
    \nAs I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
    \nAs the music dies, something in your eyes
    \nCalls to mind a silver screen
    \nAnd all its sad good-byes
    \nI\'m never gonna dance again
    \nGuilty feet have got no rhythm
    \nThough it\'s easy to pretend
    \nI know you\'re not a fool
    \nShould\'ve known better than to cheat a friend
    \nAnd waste the chance that I\'d been given
    \nSo I\'m never gonna dance again
    \nThe way I danced with you
    \nTime can never mend
    \nThe careless whispers of a good friend
    \nTo the heart and mind
    \nIgnorance is kind
    \nThere\'s no comfort in the truth
    \nPain is all you\'ll find
    \nI\'m never gonna dance again
    \nGuilty feet have got no rhythm
    \nThough it\'s easy to pretend
    \nIn know you\'re not a fool
    \nI should\'ve known better than to cheat a friend
    \nAnd waste the chance that I\'d been given
    \nSo I\'m never gonna dance again
    \nThe way I danced with you, ohh
    \nNever without your love
    \nTonight the music seems so loud
    \nI wish that we could lose this crowd
    \nMaybe it\'s better this way
    \nWe\'d hurt each other with the things we\'d want to say
    \nWe could have been so good together
    \nWe could have lived this dance forever
    \nBut now, who\'s gonna dance with me?
    \nPlease stay
    \nAnd I\'m never gonna dance again
    \nGuilty feet have got no rhythm
    \nThough it\'s easy to pretend
    \nI know you\'re not a fool
    \nShould\'ve known better than to cheat a friend
    \nAnd waste the chance that I\'d been given
    \nSo I\'m never gonna dance again
    \nThe way I danced with you
    \nNow that you\'re gone
    \n(Now that you\'re gone) Was what I did\'s so wrong, so wrong
      \n  That you had to leave me alone?\n\n</string>
